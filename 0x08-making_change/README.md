Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

1. Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
2. Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
3. If total is 0 or less, return 0
4. If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
5. coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
6. The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
7. You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
8. Your solution’s runtime will be evaluated in this taskrototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
